The PC version of Burnout Paradise received an update to version 1.1 in 2009, which added new features and improvements, such as support for high-resolution displays, custom soundtracks, mouse controls, and more. However, some players may have encountered difficulties in playing the game online after the update, due to compatibility issues or server problems.
 
If you are one of those players who want to play Burnout Paradise 1.1 online on PC, here are some steps that you can try:
 
1. Make sure that you have the latest version of the game installed. You can check your game version by launching the game and looking at the bottom left corner of the screen. If you see "v1.0.0.0", you need to update your game to version 1.1. You can download the update from [the official website](https://www.ea.com/games/burnout/burnout-paradise) or from other sources.
2. Make sure that you have an EA account and that you are logged in to it when you launch the game. You can create an EA account for free at [the EA website](https://www.ea.com/profile/register). You can also link your existing Steam account to your EA account if you bought the game from Steam.
3. Make sure that your firewall or antivirus software is not blocking the game or its online features. You may need to add an exception for the game executable (BurnoutParadise.exe) or its ports (80, 443, 9988, 20000-20100, 22990, 17502, 42127) in your firewall or antivirus settings.
4. Make sure that you have a stable internet connection and that your router or modem is not causing any issues. You may need to restart your router or modem, or change some settings such as NAT type, port forwarding, or UPnP.
5. If none of the above steps work, you may need to use a third-party software or service that allows you to play online games with other players without relying on official servers or subscriptions. One example of such software is [Evolve](https://www.evolvehq.com/welcome), which creates a virtual LAN network that lets you join or host online games with your friends or other players. You can find a tutorial on how to use Evolve to play Burnout Paradise online on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q1I3w9X7iM).

By following these steps, you should be able to enjoy Burnout Paradise 1.1 online on PC with other players. However, please note that using unofficial methods or software to play online may violate the terms of service of the game or EA, and may expose you to risks such as malware, viruses, bans, or legal actions. Therefore, we recommend that you play online only with trusted friends or players, and at your own discretion and responsibility.
